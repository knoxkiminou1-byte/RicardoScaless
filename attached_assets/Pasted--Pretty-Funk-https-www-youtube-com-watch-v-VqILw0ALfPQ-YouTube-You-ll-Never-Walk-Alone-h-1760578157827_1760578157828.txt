Here’s the refined prompt for Replit, telling it to replace the top 5 tracks, add 3 album covers (small, optimized), etc:

Prompt to feed Replit agent

Title: Enhance Music Page — Top 5 playable + album covers

Goal: Replace the top 5 tracks on the Music page with clickable YouTube embeds, and add three album covers (small, optimized) without breaking layout or removing existing content.

Instructions:

Identify top 5 tracks
Replace exactly these five tracks (in whatever order they appear):

Pretty Funk

You’ll Never Walk Alone

To Dream the Impossible Dream

You Are the One

When I Fall in Love

YouTube embedding
For each of those five, use their YouTube URLs above.
Insert as clickable tiles with small YouTube thumbnail images.
Thumbnails: use maxresdefault/hqdefault/mqdefault in that order if available.
Lazy load the thumbnails.
The existing track rows must remain—they get a layer so clicking plays.
Only one track may play at a time. Use YouTube IFrame API, deferred load.

Album covers

Add three album cover images below or beside the track list (depending on layout).

Fetch album cover images from the web (official sources).

Resize or compress them so each file size is small (e.g. < 100 KB if possible).

If they won’t fit, scale them down (dimensions or quality) until they do.

Use lazy loading for those covers too.

Fallback & unmatched
If a track fails to embed, leave its row unmodified (no broken UI).
Log that in a JSON mapping (track name → matched YouTube URL, thumbnail, success flag).

Maintain layout & content integrity
Do not remove or reorder existing elements.
Wrap new interactive layers inside the existing track row containers.
Do not change IDs or class names of existing elements.
Use your own prefixed classes (e.g. ytLayer-…) to avoid conflicts.

Handoff data & status

Produce music_links.json or similar mapping file.

Add a hidden detail block at bottom summarizing: 5 tracks processed, count of successes/failures.

Add a minimal changelog comment block (file name & short description).

Acceptance

Clicking on any of those five starts YouTube playback inline/modal.

Only one plays at once.

Album covers appear compact, optimized, and don’t break the page.

Everything else on the page stays as before.
