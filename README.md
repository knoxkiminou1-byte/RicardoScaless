## Running the App

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
- Edit [App.jsx](#src/App.jsx) and watch it live update.

For production builds, see the Vite docs on [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html).
